# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.  When looking at the Kickstarter dataset, there a number of factors that may impact a campaign’s outcome but these two factors may have a greater influence on the success rate of campaigns. Ultimately, the result(s) of this study can provide Louise with the necessary information she needs to help explain why her campaign for her play came short of meeting its funding goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
After completing all the required functions, I applied three strategies to ensure I performed a good analysis using the images and links. I studied the graphs produced, compared the results with the dataset and looked for patterns and discrepancies that yielded useful information within the assignment’s objective.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During the last module (1.6.1), I discovered my Kickstarter data source was inaccurate because my calculation/results failed to match the sample posted on the module lesson. I confirmed this by running a Vlookup between the original file and my working file. The spreadsheet was missing 68 rows of data. 

Cause of the problem: Towards the end of the week, I experienced technical errors with my *bootcampspot* portal that impacted all my Module 1 lessons. I further compromised my file by erroneously trying to fix the errors encountered in a non-sequential order. 

Resolution. I recreated many of the work using a copy file I had saved that included all 4113 rows of data and some completed work in the Kickstarter spreadsheet, especially images and calculations I needed to submit for grading. This is a reason why my “Kickstarter Challenge” file doesn’t include previous completed work done on my “Starterbook” file submitted. 

*I.T. was alerted and is workig on fixing the problem.*

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

From studying the *Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date * chart, I concluded that most successful campaigns were launched during May (111) and June (100) and the 4th quarter yields the lowest successful outcomes, totally 156, versus 282 in the 2nd quarter – the most successful period. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaign goals of less than $5,000 have the highest successful rates, between 73 – 76%. Failed campaigns rates double for goals greater than $5,000.  In sum, goals over $20,000 are not very successful, the successful rate decreases from 45% to 20% for goals over $25,000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset fails to include more detail information about the backers, especiallly where they reside and individual donation amount. This information could be useful because success can be skewed based on backers’ location, association to the creator and/or donation values. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

It would benefit to produce a table of the top 5 or 10 successful theater-play campaigns by country to highlight which countries to target.

A column graph of the success rate by year and category can show trend changes in the success rate over time.

Also a linear regression analysis can provide significance between key variables.
